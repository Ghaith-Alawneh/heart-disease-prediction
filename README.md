This project is a machine learning-based predictive model designed to estimate the risk of heart disease in patients based on clinical features.

The goal was to explore how data-driven models can assist healthcare professionals in identifying at-risk individuals early, potentially supporting preventive care and timely intervention.

The project was implemented in two environments:

Azure ML Studio: for drag-and-drop experimentation and model deployment.

Google Colab (Python):for manual model building, data preprocessing, and performance evaluation.

model.pkl was done using azure, while HeartDiseaseModel.pkl was written manually using colab.
